üîê Encryption and Decryption: Secure Your Messages

Welcome to my GitHub repository! In preparation for Google's Girl Hackathon Ideathon, I've been diving into the fascinating world of encryption techniques. As a result, I've developed a short project that focuses on the encryption and decryption of messages. 

In this project, I aimed to create a secure method to protect sensitive information while it's transmitted across various communication channels. Encryption is the process of transforming plain text into a cipher text, making it unreadable to anyone without the decryption key. Conversely, decryption is the process of converting the cipher text back into its original form.

My project leverages advanced encryption algorithms and methods to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. By employing cryptographic protocols, I aim to provide robust protection against unauthorized access to our messages.

Through this project, I intend to showcase the importance of encryption in maintaining the privacy and security of our communications. By understanding and implementing encryption techniques effectively, we can safeguard sensitive information, such as personal details, financial data, and confidential conversations.

I hope this project serves as a valuable resource for fellow participants in the ideathon and inspires further exploration into the realm of encryption. Let's empower ourselves with the knowledge and tools to protect our digital lives, fostering a safer and more secure online environment for all. Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, and join me on this exciting journey of encryption and decryption!

Together, we can make a difference in securing our communications. Happy coding! üîí
